NIST Cybersecurity Framework 5 core functions:  ### Shortcut: "IPDRR" 

Identify ‚Äì Understand risks (assets, threats, policies).
Protect ‚Äì Safeguard systems (access control, training, encryption).
Detect ‚Äì Find threats early (monitoring, anomalies).
Respond ‚Äì Act during/after incidents (containment, reporting).
Recover ‚Äì Restore operations (backups, lessons learned).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gap Analysis = Compare current security vs. ideal (NIST CSF goals), find missing pieces, and fix them.

3-Step Shortcut:
Where are we now? (Check tools/policies in place).   # Current: No backups.
Where should we be? (NIST‚Äôs 5 functions).   # Ideal: NIST "Recover" needs backups.
What‚Äôs missing? (Prioritize quick wins vs. long-term).   # Gap: Set up automated backups.
# Output: A simple table or list of gaps to fix. üõ†Ô∏è

CONTROL OBJECTIVE =      ( Specific security goals (e.g., "Block 99% of malware) )
* Objective: Prevent unauthorized access.
* Control: MFA.
* Measure: % of users enrolled (Functionality), login attacks blocked (Effectiveness).

CONTROLS = ( Tools/actions to hit those goals (e.g., antivirus, firewalls)
* Reducing, eliminating, Fixing vulnerabilities  
* Lowering exploit chances    
* Reducing impact of exploits

COUNTERMEASURE =      (Hifazati Iqdaam)
* Functionality (what it does)  
* Effectiveness (how well it works)
* Assurance (confidence it‚Äôs working)      
* Cost-Benefit (ROI)
