Positive	Alarm says "yes, danger found"
Negative	Alarm says "no danger found"
True	Alarm's answer is correct
False	Alarm's answer is wrong


✅ TRUE POSITIVE (TP)
Alarm rings.

There is a burglar.

✔️ Correct decision.

🔔 "YES burglar" → and really a burglar is there.

❌ FALSE POSITIVE (FP)
Alarm rings.

But it's just your cat.

❌ Wrong decision.

🔔 "YES burglar" → but actually, no burglar.

✅ TRUE NEGATIVE (TN)
Alarm doesn't ring.

And your house is safe.

✔️ Correct again.

🔕 "NO burglar" → and yes, there’s no one.

❌ FALSE NEGATIVE (FN)
Alarm doesn’t ring.

But there is a burglar!

❌ Big mistake.

🔕 "NO burglar" → but a thief is inside!

. Symmetric Encryption (Same Key 🔑)
Algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Most common (128/256-bit).
DES (Deprecated, insecure).
3DES (Triple DES – Slow, being phased out).
ChaCha20 (Fast, used in TLS/SSL).


. Asymmetric Encryption (Public/Private Keys 🔐)
Algorithms:

RSA (Key exchange & signatures, slow).
ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography – Smaller keys, faster than RSA).
Diffie-Hellman (Key exchange only, not encryption).
EdDSA (Digital signatures, e.g., Ed25519).
