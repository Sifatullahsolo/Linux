Todo 



1. Master Linux Fundamentals

File System Hierarchy (/bin, /etc, /var, /home, /root)

User & Permission Management (chmod, chown, sudo, su, adduser)

Process Management (ps, top, htop, kill, systemctl)

Networking Commands (ifconfig, ip, netstat, ss, nmap, tcpdump)

Package Management (apt, yum, dnf, pip)

Bash Scripting (Automation, cron jobs, aliases)

Practice Exercises
âœ” Create a user and assign sudo privileges
âœ” Modify file permissions (chmod 600, chown)
âœ” Schedule a task with cron
âœ” Write a basic Bash script to automate log cleanup





2. Learn Security Hardening
Key Areas to Secure
SSH Security (Disable root login, use key-based auth)

Firewall Setup (ufw, iptables, firewalld)

SELinux/AppArmor (Mandatory Access Control)

Log Monitoring (journalctl, logrotate, /var/log/)

Kernel Hardening (sysctl settings, grub security)

Practice Exercises
âœ” Harden SSH by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config
âœ” Block a suspicious IP using iptables
âœ” Set up fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks

3. Use Cybersecurity Tools
Must-Know Tools
Category	Tools
Scanning	nmap, masscan, nikto, OpenVAS
Exploitation	Metasploit, sqlmap, Burp Suite
Forensics	Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark
Password Cracking	John the Ripper, hashcat
Network Analysis	tcpdump, tshark, Zeek
Practice Exercises
âœ” Scan a target with nmap -A -T4 <IP>
âœ” Crack a password hash using john --format=sha256 hashes.txt
âœ” Analyze a PCAP file in Wireshark

4. Set Up a Cybersecurity Lab
Recommended Lab Environments
Virtualization: VirtualBox, VMware, KVM

Penetration Testing OS: Kali Linux, Parrot OS

Vulnerable Machines: Metasploitable, DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop

Lab Exercises
âœ” Install Kali Linux in a VM
âœ” Exploit Metasploitable using msfconsole
âœ” Perform a CTF challenge on Hack The Box

5. Learn Scripting & Automation
Languages to Learn
Bash (Linux automation)

Python (Exploit development, tool scripting)

PowerShell (Windows security)

Practice Exercises
âœ” Write a Python script to scan open ports
âœ” Automate log analysis with Bash

6. Engage in Real-World Practice
Platforms for Hands-On Learning
Hack The Box (HTB)

TryHackMe

OverTheWire (Bandit)

VulnHub

Certifications to Consider
CompTIA Linux+

OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)

eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester)

7. Stay Updated
Follow cybersecurity blogs (KrebsOnSecurity, The Hacker News)

Join communities (Reddit r/netsec, Discord hacking groups)

Watch YouTube channels (Null Byte, The Cyber Mentor)

Final Checklist
âœ… Learn Linux basics (commands, permissions, networking)
âœ… Harden a Linux system (SSH, firewall, logs)
âœ… Practice with security tools (Metasploit, Wireshark, John)
âœ… Set up a hacking lab (Kali + Metasploitable)
âœ… Solve CTF challenges (HTB, TryHackMe)
âœ… Automate tasks with Bash/Python

ðŸš€ Consistent practice is key! Start with basics, then move to advanced exploits and defense techniques.
